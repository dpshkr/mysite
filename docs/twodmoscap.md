# Two-Dimensional MOS Capacitor

In this article, we will explore the two-dimensional MOS capacitor, 
the counterpart of the more familiar MOS capacitor.

The figure below shows the structure of the device we will analyze.
The structure has a sheet of semiconductor sandwiched between two insulators with gate electrodes.
For the present analysis, we will take up the case of a symmetric double-gate structure, i.e.,
both the insulators are identical (in thickness and dielectric constant), and an identical bias is 
applied to both the gate electrodes. 
Extending the analysis presented here to the asymmetric case should be straightforward and  trivial.
