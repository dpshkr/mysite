# Two-Dimensional MOS Capacitor

The two-dimensional MOS capacitor is the 2D analogue of its more familiar 3D MOS capacitor, 
traditionally known as a MOS capacitor.
The structure of a 2D MOS capacitor is shown below.
An ultrathin sheet of semiconducting material is sandwiched between two insulators connected to gate electrodes.
For the present analysis, we will take up the case of a symmetric structure where 
both insulators have the same thickness and permittivity, and the gate electrodes are made of the same material.
The extension of this analysis to the asymmetric case is trivial.

## Band-bending vs Band-movement

We will assume the thickness of the semiconductor to be zero.
This assumption is quite reasonable for a monolayer but would not hold for a few-layer semiconductor.
Because the semiconducting layer has no thickness, 
there is no possibility of variation of electrostatic potential along its thickness (indicated by the *y*-direction in the figure).
This contrasts with a 3D semiconductor, where the potential varies along the semiconductor, leading to what is called "band-bending".
A 2D MOS capacitor has no band-bending. 
Only the surface electrostatic potential of the semiconductor changes, leading to the movement of bands relative to the Fermi level.

## Electrostatic Analysis

Since we are dealing with a MOS capacitor structure, 
wherein the semiconductor is connected to only one terminal (presently grounded), 
there would be no lateral variation (*x*-direction) of electrostatic potential.
Later on, when we take up the 2D transistor, 
we will deal with a change in lateral variation of electrostatic potential.
As we saw just now, the semiconductor's ultrathin nature ensures no variation 
in electrostatic potential along the material's thickness (*y*-direction).
The semiconductor is hence an equipotential surface at an electrostatic potential $\phi_s$.
Our main problem is finding $\phi_s$ given the gate bias $V_G$ and material properties.

Let us consider a 2D semiconducting sheet at $\phi_s=0$.
